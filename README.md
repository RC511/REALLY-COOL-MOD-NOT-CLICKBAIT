Or don't. It's not really up to me.

Just a quick reminder and disclaimer that this is my first ever Minecraft mod!
Not much is added, and they might not work.

Several items are added to the game:
- Really Cool Item! Not Clickbait!
- Really Cool Block! Not Clickbait!
- Really Cool Thingamajig! Not Clickbait!
- Really Cool Armour Set! Not Clickbait! (4 items, of course.)

The Really Cool Block! Not Clickbait! is used to make the Really Cool Thingamajig! Not Clickbait!
It can also be used to make (very expensive) beacons.
The Really Cool Thingamajig! Not Clickbait! is a multitool that can act as most tools (except shears... or bucket... or hoe).
The Really Cool Item! Not Clickbait! is the repair material for the Really Cool Thingamajig! Not Clickbait!
The Really Cool Armour Set! Not Clickbait! has double the protection of diamond armour! (Textures might be a bit buggy, but I couldn't be bothered to fix them)


Recipes:
Use JEI. Soz

Planned things:
- New dimension + biome
- New ore
- New trees
- and other ambitious things that probably won't get implemented.
